WURFL via Perl, MySQL device capabilities detection

These are the files which go along with our WURFL via Perl scripts in the osm_cgi-bin repository. They are intended to help demo and explain how WURFL via Perl works. 'perl_wurfl.cgi', 'site_wurfl.cgi' and all of 'cgi-bin/lib' are the base required files to make WURFL via Perl work. Adding in all of the mobilesiteos repository files (which includes the osm_cgi-bin repo) just makes it easier to test and see how website integration may be accomplished.
